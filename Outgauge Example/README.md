# Outgauge API example

A lil python script that is basically another web dash on port 8080, a jumping-off point for how to use the API.

## How to test it

Run the script how you please (Thonny, CMD, whatever) on your CarX computer.

Grab the local network IP of that computer (should log to console, with a direct link too. Format is 192.168.1.\*).

Head to http://\<localip\>:8080 on any device on the network with a web browser.

Start CarX if you haven't already, and flip the Outgauge API on.

Enter a track on CarX.

The device you loaded the page on should now be a live external dashboard :)
